## Project Goals

### User Goals

- Be able to understand the application intuitively
- Be able to see already guessed letters
- Receive feedback if I make an error
- Keep track of remaining lives
- Find out the word if I fail to guess it

### Application Owner Goals

- Simplistic fun
- Validates user entries to avoid errors
- Returns feedback on why an error occurs
- Offers the user to play again


| **User Story**   | **Feature or Code**                    | **Functionality**          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | 
| As a user, I want to run the game, so that I can play | The game starts automatically on run | Functioning | 
| As a user, I want to easily understand how to play the game | The game begins by guiding you to guess a single letter | Functioning | 
| As a user, I want to understand which type of input is required, and understand my mistakes if I make an error during input
 | This is covered by feature 4 | Functioning | 
| As a user, I want to clearly see the number of incorrect guesses or lives I have remaining | This is covered by feature 3 | Functioning | 
|As a user, I want to see all currently guessed letters | This is covered by feature 2 | Functioning | 
| As a user I want to see my progress on the guessed word | This is covered by feature 1 | Functioning | 
| As a user I want to be able to see what the word was, even if I didnâ€™t guess it | This is covered by feature 7 | Functioning | 
| As a user I want to be able to play again without having to restart the program | This is covered by feature 5 | Functioning |
